## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I want to build the fun stuff that everyone can enjoy.

Why? Because it is exciting what can be done, and the potential is life-changing!

Growing up, I saw computers change the world around us, from the Web to now generative AI. These are things that have opened doors, made life easier, and put smiles on peopleâ€™s faces, including mine.

Now, I want to try to open doors, make life easier, and put smiles on peopleâ€™s faces :).

Thatâ€™s why I decided to pursue Computer Science, and keep learning and living with the cutting edge.

I helped on a website that can suggest ways to improve a roomâ€™s safety against natural disasters, using Google Gemini, winning 1st place at a J.P. Morgan Chase affiliated hackathon. Right now, I am learning how to leverage LLMs even further, first with a chatbot that can easily host and make accessible local, powerful, and private models on a variety of hardware.

I want to build exciting things! Today, the excitement is AI. Whatever it is tomorrow, I will be there!
